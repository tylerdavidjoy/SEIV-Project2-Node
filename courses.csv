YTMN,YTMN-5103,5,3,Adolescent Culture,"Learned behavior is transmitted through culture. Culture is an influential teacher and culture can set the norms for acceptable behavior and paint a picture of what one should look like. It is extremely important to know and be involved in the world of adolescents if one wishes to be an influence. This course introduces students to a study of present-day American culture in which churched and non-churched adolescents exist. The course gives attention to the context of music, media, dress, values, norms, philosophy, peers, family, and school as they engage adolescents in our culture."
YTMN,YTMN-5163,5,3,Adolescent Physical and Spiritual Development,"This class will address issues in adolescent development from a life span perspective within the contexts of American adolescents. Students will discuss theories, examples, case studies, data, and clinical and field research methods that have been applied to human growth and development. The course will emphasize practical application of the course material through small group interaction, class participation, research projects, lectures, and class presentations. Formerly BIBL-5163."

[Note: M.A. students with fewer than 5 years of full- time ministry experience upon admission to the MA program must take either YTMN-5913 and YTMN-5923, or YTMN-5916 to meet the requirement for six hours of field education.
